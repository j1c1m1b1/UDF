# About this  Project
Ths project was developed in order to support the development of my Medium article: 
[Unidirectional Data Flow for Android UIs](https://medium.com/@j1c1m1b1/unidirectional-data-flow-in-for-android-uis-5edd1386f40d)

It contains an Android App Module and a Kotlin only module called presentation.

Its dependencies are:
* Kotlin Standard Library
* Kotlin Coroutines
* material components and some Jetpack libraries, the lifecycle one is worth mentioning.  

This project displays a very simple example of the usage of the interfaces declared in the 
presentation module. The code is usable but, I am sure that it can be improved as there are multiple 
articles already published related to this concept, easily accessed by a plain Google search on the
topic. Anyways I decided to publish my take on the same topic anyways, in order to "give something
back" to the community and put some of my writing and coding skills to the test.
